			"å¤©èŠ±" means "flowers falling from the skies". I adopted her from a shelter in July, 2022. She is a Bengal cat who was rescued from a pet shop. Well, they at the shelter told me she did not like other cats but loved humans! (^^)

			I have had 6 cats at maximum in my life since 1996. Right after my last cat went to his next life, Tenka came into my life. I just can't think of my life without cats.
